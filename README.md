# Creating an MCP Server in Go and Serving it with Docker

## Introduction

Today we'll look at how to create an MCP server in Go and serve it with Docker.

Prerequisites: having read [Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://k33g.hashnode.dev/understanding-the-model-context-protocol-mcp)

To write an MCP server, there are several official SDKs:

- [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- [Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk)

In recent years, I've developed an appetite for Go, so I looked around to see if there was a Go implementation. On this page [https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers?tab=readme-ov-file#frameworks](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers?tab=readme-ov-file#frameworks), I found several, notably [https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go), by the creator of `mcphost` (which I discuss and use in the [previous blog post](https://k33g.hashnode.dev/understanding-the-model-context-protocol-mcp)).

The advantage of the `mcp-go` project is that it's simple and also provides tools to develop an MCP client, which will be very useful for a future blog post.

## Creating an MCP Server

I won't detail or implement all the possibilities of an MCP server here. I'll just implement the essentials:

- Provide a list of tools for the LLM
- Execute these tools when the LLM invokes them

When I use an LLM, there's one thing I'd like to be able to do: give it a website link so it can find information there, make a summary for me, etc.

So I created an MCP server that calls the `curl` utility with a URL parameter and returns its content. But let's look at the source code:

**`go.mod`**:
```go
module mcp-curl

go 1.23.4

require github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go v0.8.2
require github.com/google/uuid v1.6.0
```

**`main.go`**:
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"

	"github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/mcp"
	"github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/server"
)

func main() {
	// Create MCP server
	s := server.NewMCPServer(
		"mcp-curl",
		"1.0.0",
	)

	// Add a tool
	tool := mcp.NewTool("use_curl",
		mcp.WithDescription("fetch this webpage"),
		mcp.WithString("url",
			mcp.Required(),
			mcp.Description("url of the webpage to fetch"),
		),
	)

	// Add a tool handler
	s.AddTool(tool, curlHandler)

	fmt.Println("ðŸš€ Server started")
	// Start the stdio server
	if err := server.ServeStdio(s); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("ðŸ˜¡ Server error: %v\n", err)
	}
	fmt.Println("ðŸ‘‹ Server stopped")
}

func curlHandler(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {

	url, ok := request.Params.Arguments["url"].(string)
	if !ok {
		return mcp.NewToolResultError("url must be a string"), nil
	}
	cmd := exec.Command("curl", "-s", url)
	output, err := cmd.Output()
	if err != nil {
		return mcp.NewToolResultError(err.Error()), nil
	}
	content := string(output)

	return mcp.NewToolResultText(content), nil
}
```

### Explanations

It's really very simple. My server will provide only one tool. The code implements a server that exposes a web "fetching" tool based on `curl` using the Model Control Protocol.

- First, I create an MCP server named `mcp-curl` version `1.0.0` that works with standard input/output (stdio)
- Then I define a tool named `use_curl` that takes a required `url` parameter
- Finally, I add the `handler` for this tool that executes the `curl` command with the `-s` option to retrieve the webpage content
- Of course, I handle errors and return the webpage content as text

## Packaging the MCP Server with Docker

To make my life easier, I'll use a `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image containing my MCP server. This way, I can more easily deploy it on different platforms or make it available to anyone who wants to use it.

**`Dockerfile`**:
```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.23.4-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod .
COPY main.go .

RUN <<EOF
go mod tidy 
go build
EOF

FROM curlimages/curl:8.6.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/mcp-curl .
ENTRYPOINT ["./mcp-curl"]
```

My `Dockerfile` has two parts:

- The first part builds my MCP server in Go
- The second part uses the `curlimages/curl:8.6.0` image that contains `curl` and copies my `mcp-curl` server into the image (so `mcp-curl` is the executable that calls `curl`)

To build the Docker image, I run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t mcp-curl .
```

And now let's see how to use our new MCP server with `mcphost`:

## Using the MCP Server with `mcphost`

First, we need to create a configuration file `mcp.json` for `mcphost`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-curl-with-docker" :{
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp-curl"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then we can use `mcphost` to use our MCP server and an LLM with Ollama, like this:

```bash
mcphost --config ./mcp.json --model ollama:qwen2.5-coder:14b
```

The MCP server is recognized by `mcphost`:

You can request the list of available tools with the `/tools` command:

Now you can request the content of a webpage and analyze its content (in my example I retrieve Go code from GitHub):
![mcp](imgs/03-mcp.png)

Wait a little bit:

And here's the webpage content:

## Conclusion

You can see that with just a few lines, it becomes really easy to give "superpowers" to your LLMs. In a future blog post, I'll show you how to create a generative AI application with Ollama and an MCP client in Go to interact with our MCP server.
